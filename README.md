# Tako

!! This repository was moved into https://github.com/It4innovations/hyperqueue
as a component of HyperQueue. Once we have more use-cases for Tako we will separate it again

Tako is a framework for running computations on a cluster computer.
Tako is derived from our previous work on https://github.com/It4innovations/rsds 
by stripping down Dask-related parts and makes the core more generic. 

Tako is a backend library for "tool builders" and it is not intended to be directly used by end-users.
